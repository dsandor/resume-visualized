# ASP.NET MVC (WebApi)
The web was changing.  RESTful services became a (good) thing and old bloated XML-RPC services were about to be put to pasture.  WCF had a JSON pipline but lets face it, it was horrible.  Along comes Guthrie's team with their own RESTful implementation as a logical extension of ASP.NET MCV.  This provided a lighter tech stack than WCF with a lot less of the configuration problems.  In 2011 I started refactoring old services and creating new services in WebApi.

#### Projects
* `Fund Accounting Software` - This product provides Quickbooks like functionality for fund accounting.  There are a lot of moving parts here but all of the services, about 200 endpoints, provide data access for the software.
