# ASP.NET
ASP.NET was my primary technology for any web development from about 2002 onward.  I was an early adopter 

#### Projects
* `Fund Accounting Software` - This product provides Quickbooks like functionality for fund accounting.  There are a lot of moving parts here but all of the services, about 200 endpoints, provide data access for the software.

* `Field Services` - End user portal used to manage reverse logistics inventory. 

* `Software Inventory & Licensing` - Enterprise portal used for end user self service of software installs and licensing.  Software was treated as a library with check-in and check-out of licenses across 28k computers.

* `Store Front` - This was a complete CRM, CMS, and online web store for selling products online.  Built from the ground up in 2003 this software lasted for about 5 years with minimal updates.

* `GradesNow.com` - From scratch build of an online grade system for public schools.  Software supported gradebooks, attendance, and communication between teacher and parents.  This software was my first startup.
