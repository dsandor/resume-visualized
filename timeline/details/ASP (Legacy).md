# ASP (Legacy)
Old school ASP before .NET was my HTML rendering/templating technology of choice.  At the time there was Cold Fusion, Java was not a contender.  I actually used ASP technology when it shipped with Microsoft SQL Server and Internet Server as HTX and IDQ files.  This was the advent of HTML template merging of queries from SQL server into HTML in a browser.  It was the first of it's kind.  Eventually HTX and IDQ turned into ASP and years later a product came out to replace notepad called Visual Interdev 1.0.  This helped ASP programmers manage the project better.  This little gem turned in to Visual Studio but not for at least 3 years.

I worked on dozens of ASP projects below are a handful of notable ones.

#### Projects
* `EmailAnywhere.net` - In it's original form, before GMAIL, before Yahoo Mail, when people charged $20 a month for an email account I wrote a free email system (like GMAIL) in ASP and ran it this way for at least 2 years.  I had thousands of subscribers and had to build some custom SMPT and POP3 components because modern email was pretty new.

* `My Casino Accounts` - Online account management (think Quickbooks Online) for Online Casino owners.  This processed payments to the owners and payouts to big winners.

* `GradesNow.com` - Originally an ASP application that was later converted to ASP.NET.  This provided Teachers and Parents a connectivity point in the student's grades.
