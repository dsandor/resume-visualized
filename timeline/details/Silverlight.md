# Silverlight

When Silverlight hit critical mass I did a few Line of Business (LOB) applications with it.  At the time products like AngularJS and Bootstrap were in their infancy.  Silverlight was considered better than Flash and as a .NET developer it seemed to fit well.

### Projects

* `Inventory Control Management` - This application allowed warehouse workers to receive inventory into Microsoft Dynamics AX.  The Silverlight application interfaced with handheld scanners.  This application was built from scratch (there were not any third party components at that time).

* `Field Receipts & Returns` - Similar to the ICM application described above this allowed end users to indicate when a package was received.  It also facilitated returns / RMA generation.

* `Remote Printer Management` - My company needed the ability for users in **London, UK** to print to specialized serial printers in **Atlanta, GA**.  I created a print job routing program that provided this functionality.  The RPM software allowed the configuration of the softwar and services.

*  `Sales Quote Generation` - This application spidered websites and forums centered around the sale and purchase of used networking equipment.  Server processes would analyze the data and generate buy and sell leads for sales associates.  Sales associates would use this tool to create custom quotes for customers.  This data would feed into Microsoft Dynamics AX.

##### Silverlight is now a dead technology but it was fun to develop in while it was around.
