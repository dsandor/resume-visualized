# Visual Basic
This development was of the Version 5.0 and Version 6.0 varieties.  I built anything from ActiveX controls, COM+ and DCOM components to full scale shrink wrapped software for high speed OCR.

* `ImageQuest` - This software is a high speed scanning and OCR solution for tax collectors.  The initial and primary customer is the Orange County Tax Collectors office.  This software was used in conjunction with envelope openers and check scanners.  As tax bills are opened they are scanned into this software which then performs OCR on the checks and tax bill forms to marry the payment to the account automatically.

* `Remote System Administration ActiveX` - This was a  component of a software inventory, management, and licensing application that ran every time a user opened the web browser on their laptop.  The software was trusted in a way that gave full control on the machine.  This component was uses to queue up system management jobs when a user logged in.  This predates System Management Center by 5 years and System Center by 10 years.
