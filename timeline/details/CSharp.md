# C&#35;

While I was working at MCI / WorldCom our Microsoft Technical Account Manager (TAM) told me about this new vNext technology that Microsoft was cooking up called `.NET`.  He also told me of this new language that was going to power this new tech and it was called **C&#35;**.  My team at the time was a group of Visual Basic 5.0/6.0 and ASP(vbscript) developers.  We took the plunge with this new language and 2 weeks later we were fully converted project wise and philosophically.

Since I started writing software in C# as an early adopter I have produced hundreds (not an overstatement) of application in C#.  Too many to list individually.

#### Consulting for Microsoft
Microsoft Learning approached me to help write material for .NET exams dealing with C#.  From early on I assisted with these, creating questions, editing and performing on-site workgroups with MSL staff to solidify the exams.  If you took a Microsoft Certified Professional exam for a certification, chances are I wrote or edited at least one question on that exam.

Some of these engagements early on were direct consulting with Microsoft.  For legal reasons MSL started having us contract through a vendor that provided offshore editing support but the interaction was largely the same.
